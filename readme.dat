Codes carry out GA training of neural-net demon from https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10853, for Ising model magnetization reversal.

I run GA by compiling taskfarmer

g++ -Wall -o deschamps taskfarmer_l2w_ga.c -lm -O

and then running

sbatch deschamps.sh

You'll have to change the cluster-specific commands in taskfarmer_l2w_ga.c and deschamps.sh to work on your cluster.

The code l2w_amc.c runs aMC or GA, but is currently set for GA. The flow of the code can be understood by starting from the main() function.
